**Abstract:**
This report details our approach to automating the verification of textual claims using deep learning techniques. We developed a fact-checking model leveraging transformers for feature extraction and dense layers for classification. The data underwent thorough preprocessing, including text normalization and tokenization, before being embedded using custom embeddings. Our model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of claims and corresponding evidence, achieving promising results with significant improvements in claim veracity prediction. We discuss the challenges encountered, such as handling unbalanced data and the complexity of linguistic nuances in claim formulation. Our findings highlight the importance of custom embeddings and model design in improving fact-checking performance.
